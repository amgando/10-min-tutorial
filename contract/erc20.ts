/**
 * EIP 20: ERC-20 Token Standard
 *
 * ERC-20 is a standard interface for tokens which allows for the implementation
 * of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts. This standard provides
 * basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved
 * so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.
 *
 * A standard interface allows any tokens to be re-used by other applications,
 * from wallets to decentralized exchanges.
